# Assets

This project expects the **Full Garden Game Pack** from:
https://penzilla.itch.io/garden-game-pack

After purchase, extract the asset pack into this folder so that the structure matches:

```
assets/
  Full_Garden_Game/
    Booth/
    GrassAndTiles/
      GreenGrass/
      OrangeGrass/
      PinkGrass/
      WhiteGrass/
      YellowGrass/
    GrassDecor/
    Plants/
    UiMenu/
```

If the folder names differ, update the asset references in the Flutter app accordingly.
